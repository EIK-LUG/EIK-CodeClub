# EIK-CodeClub

EIK CodeClub is a place where students can come to hone their programming skills.

Some of the activities we will be doing:

* Solving challenges on Codecademy, HackerRank and the like
* Building projects (we will supply projects for different skill levels or come with your own!)
* Supporting with programming homework assignments
* Technology demos, with accompanying intro use cases
* Having fun :) 

## FAQ

Q: What if I have very little confidence in my skill?

A: No worries, there is no minimum skill requirement. There will be beginner friendly stuff. :)

Q: If you guys have been active for a while, can I keep up?

A: Yes, we won't be following a schedule. Understanding will mostly not depend on previous CodeClub participation.

Q: What programming languages do you use?

A: Currently we can offer the most support with python, java, javascript, C/C++, clojure and clojurescript, although with higher level algorithmic and software design problems the language doesn't matter.
